### Hello!

I am Joel, a software developer with a focus on the UI/x Front-end design. In my recent past I focused on Human Centered Design principles to help create apps and systems. I love visualizing data & organizing content to add context and clarity with beautiful colors and typography. I have a passion for pixel and color accurracy along with a post-modern geometric aesthetic. 

I've worked in both corporate and private design teams and try to bring a simple and honest viewpoint when tackling design problems. I aim to have those around me feel part of the process and elevate attitudes when projects get complex and there are tons of details to consider. 

## What I've done lately 

I recently contributed to developing a component library at BNY Mellon, improving user/client interaction with account processing and data features in the client services applications.

Where I...

🌐 Explored front-end frameworks for enhanced client experience.
p
💬 Utilized conversational UI patterns to align with user/client mindset.

📊 Crafted meaningful chart options for user/client benefit.

🔄 Enhanced user experience through testing and feedback iterations.
